    "contents" : "-----------------------------------\nversion 2.4.11, 2013-01-20\n- Added function carbex to experiment potential future changes. DO NOT USE this function\n\n\n-----------------------------------\nversion 2.4.10, 2013-04-17\n- Added function carbex to experiment potential future changes. DO NOT USE this function\n\n-----------------------------------\nversion 2.4.9, 2013-03-11\n- Replaced Kh by K0, the right symbol for the solubility of carbon dioxide in sea water. Many functions and help files were changed.\n- The range of salinity for K1 and K2 according to Roy et al. (1993) was wrong (0-45). The correct range of salinity (5-45) is now used. Several functions, including K1 and K2, and their help files were changed.\n\n-----------------------------------\nversion 2.4.8, 2013-02-22\nThe previous version 2.4.7 was rejected by CRAN. This version is an attempt to fix two issues. There are no bug fix nor new capabilities.\n\n-----------------------------------\nversion 2.4.7, 2013-01-18 [not distributed through CRAN which rejected it]\nThanks to James Orr for identifying the errors below and providing corrected code for all the routines mentioned.\n- Corrected a bug in the calculation of Kf, the stability constant of hydrogen fluoride, according to Dickson and Goyet (1994)[flag kf=\"dg\"]. The effect on computed results is negligible.\n- Corrected a bug in the pressure correction of Ksi, the dissociation constant of Si(OH)4. The coefficient a2 had the wrong sign. There is no impact on surface values; small but significant differences will be found for deep samples where Si concentrations are substantial.\n- Modified calculations of Kw, K1p, K2p, K3p and Ksi to use the exact method to convert each constant from the seawater to the total scale instead of the approximation that simply subtracts 0.015 (Dickson et al., 2007, Chapter 5, page 14, footnote 5). That \"constant\" now varies from 0.000 to 0.032, but the impact on computed results are quite small (as are differences between the Seawater and Total scales)\n- Made minor changes to Kf and kconv for consistent recovery of the kf option.\n\n-----------------------------------\nversion 2.4.6, 2012-12-12\n- Corrected a small bug which prevented to use function K2 with a vector.\n\n-----------------------------------\nversion 2.4.5, 2012-10-18\nThanks to Jean-Marie Epitalon for reporting the following two minor errors.\n- Minor error corrected in the documentation of carb (example of method #1, Sit and Pt were not corretly used)\n- \"seacarb_test\" removed as it is no longer used. It was replaced by \"seacarb_test_P0\" and \"seacarb_test_P300\" long ago but remained in the documentation.\n\n-----------------------------------\nversion 2.4.4, 2012-06-26\n- Modification on Pcorrect to optimise processing speed.\n- New function zzz.R which loads Pcoeff when package is loaded.\n\n-----------------------------------\nversion 2.4.3, 2011-11-13\n- New function: carbm Returns parameters of the seawater carbonate system, in case of artificial addition of boron in seawater.\n- bor, buffer, bufferesm, oa, Om, pCa, pgas, pHinsi, pmix, pTA were modified in order to add the formulation of Lee et al. (2011) to compute total boron from salinity.\n\n-----------------------------------\nversion 2.4.2, 2011-05-25\n- Fixed a major bug in Om\n\n-----------------------------------\nversion 2.4.1, 2011-03-21\n- Changed name of function oMgCa to Om in preparation for consistency with new functions Oa (aragonite saturation state) and Oc (calcite saturation state). Sorry for the inconvenience.\n- Fixed small mistakes in the ChangeLog\n\n-----------------------------------\nversion 2.4, 2011-03-15\n- New function: at computes total alkalinity with potentiometric titration data\n- New function: oMgCa computes the saturation state of magnesian calcite\n- New function: Pcorrect performs pressure corrections of the dissociation constants\n- New data set: alkalinity (see function at)\n- New data set: Pcoeffs (see function Pcorrect)\n- Kf: bug fixed when using Dickson and Goyet formulation with the free and seawater scale\n\n-----------------------------------\nversion 2.3.5, 2010-09-06\n- New function: buffesm contributed to by Jim Orr\n\n-----------------------------------\nversion 2.3.4, 2010-04-23\n- New functions: p2d and d2p to convert pressure to depth and vice versa.\n- Kb: pressure correction modified in order to be consistent with Millero (1979). \n- Kw modified in order to be consistent with Dickson et al. (2007). \n- Pressure correction constants in Kw were modified in order to be consistent with a seawater system (and not fresh water), according to Millero 1983. \n- The changes on Kb and Kw were made following comments from James Rae, to whom we are grateful. \n\n-----------------------------------\nversion 2.3.3, 2010-03-29\n- New functions: p2fCO2 and f2pCO2 to convert pCO2 to fCO2 and vice versa.\n- K1p, K2p, K3p, Kb, Kf, Khs, Kn, Ks, Kw, Ksi were modified in order to return warnings if they are used outside of the ranges of salinity and temperature of the formulations used.  \n- carb was modified in order to return NA if an NA is given in var1 or var2. \n- K1 and K2 were modified in order to add the formulation of Millero (2010). \n- Ks was modified in order to add the formulation of Khoo et al. (1977).  \n- Minor changes to the documentation of K1, K2 and Kf. Also, the reference to Kf was changed to Dickson and Riley (1979 in Dickson and Goyet, 1994).\n\n-----------------------------------\nversion 2.3.2, 2010-03-04\n- carb was modified in order to fix minor bugs occurring when a pH scale other than the total scale is used. \n- K1 and K2 were modified in order to add the calculation from Millero et al. (2006). \n- The default values of K1, K2 and Kh now depend on T and S.\n- minor changes to the documentation of Ks, \n- K1, K2 and Kf were modified in order to return warnings if they are used out of the T/S range of validity of formulations. \n\n-----------------------------------\nversion 2.3.1, 2010-01-26\n- minor changes to the documentation\n- In order to better reflect the contribution of the authors, the main authors are now Lavigne & Gattuso and Proye is listed as a contributor\n\n-----------------------------------\nversion 2.3, 2010-01-06\n- identical to 2.2.3\n\n-----------------------------------\nversion 2.2.3, 2010-01-06\n- minor changes on function ocean acidification and its help file\n\n-----------------------------------\nversion 2.2.2, 2009-12-31\n- oa: new function added. It describes the different ways to simulate an ocean acidification.\n- Minor corrections in pph to take into account the dilution effect on DIC and ALK. However, the effect of dilution on salinity is not taken into account (i.e; it is assumed that the salinity change is minor or that the acid added has the same salinity as the sample).\n\n-----------------------------------\nversion 2.2.1, 2009-10-17\n- Help of pmix revised with the correct definition of wf: \"Weight fraction of the high CO2 seawater per kg seawater\" (instead of \"Weight fraction of the high CO2 seawater vs normal seawater\")\n- Other minor changes to some help files.\n\n-----------------------------------\nversion 2.2, 2009-10-06\n- Andreas Hofmann identified bugs in the pressure corrections. These were fixed as explained below.\n- K1, K2, pK1, pK2, pK3, Kw, Kb, Khs, Ksi: pH is converted from the total to the SWS scale before doing the pressure corrections.\n- Kf using the Perez and Fraga formulation (kf = \"pf\"): pH is converted from the total to the free scale before doing the pressure correction\n- kconv: it is now possible to choose the formulation of Kf (\"pf\" for using Kf from Perez and Fraga (1987) and \"dg\" for using Kf from Dickson and Riley (1979 in Dickson and Goyet, 1994), default is \"pf\").\n- K1, K2, pK1, pK2, pK3, Kw, Kb, Khs, Ksi: help files updated with information on the pressure correction.\n- Kh, Kspa and Kspc: minor changes were made in the example section of the help files.\n\n-----------------------------------\nversion 2.1.5, 2009-07-17\n- corrected citations and list of references in the man pages of the carb function.\n\n-----------------------------------\nversion 2.1.4, 2009-07-09\n- Another attempt to put line breaks in the documentation files\n\n-----------------------------------\nversion 2.1.3, 2009-06-20\n- carb was modified in order to fix some bugs occurring when extremes values were given in arguments. \n- renamed data set \"seacarb_test\" for P=0 as \"seacarb_test_P0\"\n- added a new data set \"seacarb_test_P0\" for P=300. \n\n-----------------------------------\nversion 2.1.2, 2009-05-26\n- Cosmetic changes in the documentation\n\n--------------------------\nversion 2.1.1, 2009-04-30\n- New functions: pH, pHslope, tris, amp\n\n--------------------------\nversion 2.1.0, 2009-04-21\n- the pHscales were added in option to calculate the constants of acidity and in the functions : carb, buffer, pgas, pTA, pCa, ppH, pmix and psi.\n- the choice of the method of calculation for K1, K2 and Kf was added in option in the functions : carb, buffer, pgas, pTA, pCa, ppH, pmix and psi.\n- two bugs were fixed in the function carb: one about effect of pressure (P) and the other one in the computation of pCO2 and fCO2 when (P>0).\n- pHconv was changed in order to fix a bug and facilitate his using.\n\n--------------------------\nversion 2.0.9, 2009-04-20\n- added function psi\n\n--------------------------\nversion 2.0.8, 2009-04-16\n- changed the help file of seacarb_test to remove the use of \\item (it prevented compilation on CRAN).\n\n--------------------------\nversion 2.0.7, 2009-04-07\n- changed the help file of ppH to correct an error concerning the addition of acid (the normality was wrong).\n\n--------------------------\nversion 2.0.6, 2009-02-09\nChanges made thanks to comments kindly provided by Andreas Hofmann (A.Hofmann@nioo.knaw.nl):\n- Kf was modified in order to convert Kf from free scale to total scale after pressure corrections in the Dickson and Goyet Method.\n\n--------------------------\nversion 2.0.5, 2008-12-08\nChanges made thanks to comments kindly provided by Andreas Hofmann (A.Hofmann@nioo.knaw.nl):\n- K2 modified to fix a bug which provided warnings when several pressures were used.\n- Khs modified to fix a bug (in coefficient a2).\n- The value of the R constant was updated according to Dickson et al.
